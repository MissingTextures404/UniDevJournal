    <h1>Week 1 - Welcome Week</h1>

    <p>Welcome week was an introduction to the course.  As an ice breaker and to get to know our fellow students in our new course we started off building a lego model based on something the person sitting next to you liked or disliked.  My fellow student liked dragons and I felt that was something I could easily make out of lego.</p>
    <p>In our next session, we had to do a two-week project called the Make It manifesto project brief. This brief was to get us used to the idea of a manifesto and the important roles of a manifesto. We looked at two things each person the group aspired to and then discussed everyones aspirations and looked at the correlation between them, if any. For our Manifesto we decided to do a forest with trees and some orangutans. We were introduced to an open source programme called Open Brush.  This is a VR painting tool. I really liked this 3d tool and downloaded it on my personal VR headset, so I could practice it at home.</p>

    <h1>Week 2</h1>

    <p>The basics of HTML were taught to us during our workshop lesson.  I learned how HTML and CSS are building blocks for creating websites.  HTML provides the structure and content, while CSS defines the visual presentation and layout. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it uses ‘markup’ to describe the structure of the content to the web browser. It uses tags, elements, structure, content type, attributes, and Semantics to form the programming language. We learnt how to use it and what commands did basic things such as how to add paragraphs, headers, fonts, colours etc. Here is an example of my first html coding.</p>

    <p>In our workshop this week we completed the Make it Manifesto project. My contribution to the Manifesto project, was drawing the trees and recording the video.</p>
    <p>Here is our manifesto</p>

    <h1>Week 3</h1>

    <p>We looked at CSS in our workshop today.  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  It is a style of sheet language that is used to control the look, feel, and layout of HTML elements.  It uses Selectors, Declaration Blocks, Properties and Values, the box model, Integrations, and Key properties. We were told more about the Gallery Project we had to create and I got to work thinking of designs and the best way to go about the project. I had a good look at the basics of CSS and I taught myself how to use CSS grid after I had tried to use Flexbox for my gallery work,  and I taught myself how to use CSS grid after trying to use Flexbox for my gallery work, but unfortunately I couldn’t get it to work the way I wanted to, so decided to try another method. I also learnt how to use custom fonts and also how to add a favicon.  I actually taught myself this, but then we learnt how to do it in our next workshop.</p>
